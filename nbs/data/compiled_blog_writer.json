Default hint and rationale types can also be customized using the `DEFAULT_HINT_TYPE` and `DEFAULT_RATIONALE_TYPE` constants. This flexibility allows us to adapt our model to different use cases and improve its performance in specific tasks.\n \nThe `ChainOfThoughtWithHint` class in DSPy provides a way to incorporate chain of thought reasoning and hints into predictive models. It inherits from the `Predict` class and takes additional parameters such as `signature`, `rationale_type`, `activated`, and `config`. The `activated` parameter determines whether chain of thought reasoning should be activated, while the `rationale_type` parameter specifies the type of rationale for the reasoning steps. If this parameter is not provided, it defaults to the `DEFAULT_RATIONALE_TYPE`. This class allows for more detailed and nuanced predictions by incorporating hints and reasoning steps into the model's output.\n \nThe ChainOfThoughtWithHint class is a subclass of Predict that adds additional parameters for rationale_type and activated. It creates two distinct signature templates internally depending on the presence of hint and rationale_type. If hint is present, it sets self.extended_signature to a new Template object created from the instructions and extended_kwargs passed in the constructor. Otherwise, it sets it to the original signature. The ChainOfThoughtWithHint class is used for chain of thought reasoning when the model is activated or if it's a GPT3 model. It takes keyword arguments required for prediction as parameters and returns the result of the forward method.\n \nThe `Predict` class in our context is a subclass of `Parameter`, which is used to pass parameters to a model during training or prediction. Its constructor takes two arguments - `signature` and `**config`. The `signature` argument specifies the input and output fields required for prediction, and it can be either a string or an instance of `Signature`. If it's a string, the constructor processes the input and output fields, generates instructions, and creates a template for the specified signature type.\n \nThe activated parameter in the ChainOfThoughtWithHint signature is a boolean value that determines whether chain of thought reasoning should be applied during prediction. By default, this parameter is only set to True for GPT3 models or when a hint is present in the input data. However, by explicitly setting activated to True, we can force chain of thought reasoning to be applied regardless of these conditions. This provides greater flexibility and customization in our predictive models, allowing us to apply more complex reasoning steps as needed for specific tasks.\n \nDSPy's signature-based predictive models with chain of thought reasoning activated or if the language model is a GPT3 model offer a flexible and customizable framework for NLP applications. The `Predict` class creates two distinct signature templates internally depending on the presence of the hint, with additional config options for extended signatures. During prediction, keyword arguments are passed to the `forward` method, which returns the result of the forward pass through the predictive model. This implementation provides a powerful and versatile toolset for chain of thought reasoning in NLP applications using DSPy.\n \nIn order to implement chain of thought reasoning with hint using the new signature class in dspy library, we first import the necessary modules and classes. Then, we define a subclass `ChainOfThoughtWithHint` of the `Predict` class, which takes additional parameters such as `rationale_type`, `activated`, and `hint`. In the constructor, we set the stage and create two distinct signature templates based on the presence of the hint. We also define a new signature template with extended instructions and additional config options for chain of thought reasoning. Finally, we return the result of the `forward` method, which is the output of the predictive model. This allows us to easily incorporate chain of thought reasoning with hint into our models using dspy library.\n \nIn summary, a signature is a set of instructions that a predictive model follows in order to make a prediction. Depending on the presence of a hint, we use either the BasicQA or ChainOfThoughtWithHint signature for prediction. Keyword arguments required for prediction are passed in as arguments to the signature, and additional config options can be added if necessary. The forward method is then called to make the prediction.\n \n",
