Many studies have shown\nthat LLMs can perform a series of complex tasks\nthrough ICL, such as solving mathematical reason-\ning problems (Wei et al., 2022c). These strong abil-\nities have been widely verified as emerging abilities\nfor large language models (Wei et al., 2022b).\nThe key idea of in-context learning is to learn\nfrom analogy. Figure 1 gives an example describ-\ning how language models make decisions with ICL.\nFirst, ICL requires a few examples to form a demon-\nstration context. These examples are usually writ-\nten in natural language templates. Then, ICL con-\ncatenates a query question and a piece of demon-\nstration context together to form a prompt, which\nReview: Delicious food!

It has been a\\nnew trend to explore ICL to evaluate and ex-\\ntrapolate the ability of LLMs. In this paper,\\nwe aim to survey and summarize the progress\\nand challenges of ICL. We first present a for-\\nmal definition of ICL and clarify its corre-\\nlation to related studies. Then, we organize\\nand discuss advanced techniques, including\\ntraining strategies, demonstration designing\\nstrategies, as well as related analysis. Finally,\\nwe discuss the challenges of ICL and provide\\npotential directions for further research. We\\nhope that our work can encourage more re-\\nsearch on uncovering how ICL works and\\nimproving ICL.\\n1 Introduction\\nWith the scaling of model size and corpus size (De-\\nvlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al.,\\n2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), large language\\nmodels (LLMs) demonstrate an in-context learn-\\ning (ICL) ability, that is, learning from a few ex-\\namples in the context. Many studies have shown\\nthat LLMs can perform a series of complex tasks\\nthrough ICL, such as solving mathematical reason-\\ning problems (Wei et al., 2022c). These strong abil-\\nities have been widely verified as emerging abilities\\nfor large language models (Wei et al., 2022b).\\nThe key idea of in-context learning is to learn\\nfrom analogy. Figure 1 gives an example describ-\\ning how language models make decisions with ICL.\\nFirst, ICL requires a few examples to form a demon-\\nstration context. These examples are usually writ-\\nten in natural language templates. Then, ICL con-\\ncatenates a query question and a piece of demon-\\nstration context together to form a prompt, which\\nReview: Delicious food!

ICL re-\\nquires a piece of demonstration context containing a few\\nexamples written in natural language templates. Taking\\nthe demonstration and a query as the input, large lan-\\nguage models are responsible for making predictions.\\nis then fed into the language model for prediction.\\nDifferent from supervised learning requiring a train-\\ning stage that uses backward gradients to update\\nmodel parameters, ICL does not conduct parameter\\nupdates and directly performs predictions on the\\npretrained language models. The model is expected\\nto learn the pattern hidden in the demonstration and\\naccordingly make the right prediction.\\nAs a new paradigm, ICL has multiple attractive\\nadvantages. First, since the demonstration is writ-\\nten in natural language, it provides an interpretable\\ninterface to communicate with LLMs (Brown et al.,\\n2020). This paradigm makes it much easier to in-\\ncorporate human knowledge into LLMs by chang-\\ning the demonstration and templates (Liu et al.,\\n2022; Lu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\\n2022c). Second, in-context learning is similar to\\nthe decision process of human beings by learning\\nfrom analogy (Winston, 1980). Third, compared\\nwith supervised training, ICL is a training-free\\nlearning framework. This could not only greatly re-\\nduce the computation costs for adapting the model\\n\']\noutput: \n']"

Many studies have shown\nthat LLMs can perform a series of complex tasks\nthrough ICL, such as solving mathematical reason-\ning problems (Wei et al., 2022c). These strong abil-\nities have been widely verified as emerging abilities\nfor large language models (Wei et al., 2022b).\nThe key idea of in-context learning is to learn\nfrom analogy. Figure 1 gives an example describ-\ning how language models make decisions with ICL.\nFirst, ICL requires a few examples to form a demon-\nstration context. These examples are usually writ-\nten in natural language templates. Then, ICL con-\ncatenates a query question and a piece of demon-\nstration context together to form a prompt, which\nReview: Delicious food!

ICL re-\nquires a piece of demonstration context containing a few\nexamples written in natural language templates. Taking\nthe demonstration and a query as the input, large lan-\nguage models are responsible for making predictions.\nis then fed into the language model for prediction.\nDifferent from supervised learning requiring a train-\ning stage that uses backward gradients to update\nmodel parameters, ICL does not conduct parameter\nupdates and directly performs predictions on the\npretrained language models. The model is expected\nto learn the pattern hidden in the demonstration and\naccordingly make the right prediction.\nAs a new paradigm, ICL has multiple attractive\nadvantages. First, since the demonstration is writ-\nten in natural language, it provides an interpretable\ninterface to communicate with LLMs (Brown et al.,\n2020). This paradigm makes it much easier to in-\ncorporate human knowledge into LLMs by chang-\ning the demonstration and templates (Liu et al.,\n2022; Lu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2022c). Second, in-context learning is similar to\nthe decision process of human beings by learning\nfrom analogy (Winston, 1980).

High scores are awarded to contexts that demonstrate coherent organization and logical progression, whereas low scores indicate a lack of structure or clarity in progression.\nrelevance: Judge the pertinence of the content to the main topic, awarding high scores to contexts tightly focused on the subject without unnecessary digressions, and low scores to those that are cluttered with irrelevant information.\nStructure your JSON output to reflect these criteria as keys with their corresponding scores as values\n    \n\nThe output should be a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {""properties"": {""foo"": {""title"": ""Foo"", ""description"": ""a list of strings"", ""type"": ""array"", ""items"": {""type"": ""string""}}}, ""required"": [""foo""]}\nthe object {""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

It has been a\nnew trend to explore ICL to evaluate and ex-\ntrapolate the ability of LLMs. In this paper,\nwe aim to survey and summarize the progress\nand challenges of ICL. We first present a for-\nmal definition of ICL and clarify its corre-\nlation to related studies. Then, we organize\nand discuss advanced techniques, including\ntraining strategies, demonstration designing\nstrategies, as well as related analysis. Finally,\nwe discuss the challenges of ICL and provide\npotential directions for further research. We\nhope that our work can encourage more re-\nsearch on uncovering how ICL works and\nimproving ICL.\n1 Introduction\nWith the scaling of model size and corpus size (De-\nvlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al.,\n2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), large language\nmodels (LLMs) demonstrate an in-context learn-\ning (ICL) ability, that is, learning from a few ex-\namples in the context. Many studies have shown\nthat LLMs can perform a series of complex tasks\nthrough ICL, such as solving mathematical reason-\ning problems (Wei et al., 2022c). These strong abil-\nities have been widely verified as emerging abilities\nfor large language models (Wei et al., 2022b).\nThe key idea of in-context learning is to learn\nfrom analogy. Figure 1 gives an example describ-\ning how language models make decisions with ICL.\nFirst, ICL requires a few examples to form a demon-\nstration context. These examples are usually writ-\nten in natural language templates. Then, ICL con-\ncatenates a query question and a piece of demon-\nstration context together to form a prompt, which\nReview: Delicious food!

The food is awful. Terrible dishes!\u2026Review: [Text] Sentiment: [Label]TextLabel100\u2026\nFigure 1: Illustration of in-context learning. ICL re-\nquires a piece of demonstration context containing a few\nexamples written in natural language templates. Taking\nthe demonstration and a query as the input, large lan-\nguage models are responsible for making predictions.\nis then fed into the language model for prediction.\nDifferent from supervised learning requiring a train-\ning stage that uses backward gradients to update\nmodel parameters, ICL does not conduct parameter\nupdates and directly performs predictions on the\npretrained language models. The model is expected\nto learn the pattern hidden in the demonstration and\naccordingly make the right prediction.\nAs a new paradigm, ICL has multiple attractive\nadvantages. First, since the demonstration is writ-\nten in natural language, it provides an interpretable\ninterface to communicate with LLMs (Brown et al.,\n2020). This paradigm makes it much easier to in-\ncorporate human knowledge into LLMs by chang-\ning the demonstration and templates (Liu et al.,\n2022; Lu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2022c). Second, in-context learning is similar to\nthe decision process of human beings by learning\nfrom analogy (Winston, 1980). Third, compared\nwith supervised training, ICL is a training-free\nlearning framework. This could not only greatly re-\nduce the computation costs for adapting the model\n\ncontext2: In-context LearningTraining Warmup (\u00a74)Supervised\nIn-context\nTraining (\u00a74.1)MetaICL (Min et al., 2022b), OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022), FLAN (Wei et al., 2022a),\nSuper-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022c), Scaling Instruction (Chung et al., 2022),\nSymbol Tuning (Wei et al., 2023a)\nSelf-supervised\nIn-context\nTraining (\u00a74.2)Self-supervised ICL (Chen et al., 2022a), PICL (Gu et al., 2023)\nInferenceDemonstration\nDesigning (\u00a75)Organization (\u00a75.1)Selecting\n(\u00a75.1.1)KATE (Liu et al., 2022), EPR (Rubin et al., 2022), PPL (Gonen et al., 2022),\nSG-ICL (Kim et al., 2022a), Self Adaptive (Wu et al., 2022),MI (Sorensen et al., 2022),\nQ-Learning (Zhang et al., 2022a), Informative Score (Li and Qiu, 2023a),\nTopic (Wang et al., 2023e), UDR (Li et al., 2023f)\nOrdering\n(\u00a75.1.2)GlobalE&LocalE (Lu et al., 2022)\nFormatting (\u00a75.2)Instruction\n(\u00a75.2.1)Instruction Induction (Honovich et al., 2022), APE (Zhou et al., 2022c),\nSelf-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022b)\nReasoning\nSteps\n(\u00a75.2.2)CoT (Wang et al., 2022b), Complex CoT (Fu et al., 2022),\nAutoCoT (Zhang et al., 2022b), Self-Ask (Press et al., 2022),\nMoT(Li and Qiu, 2023b), SuperICL(Xu et al., 2023b)\niCAP (Wang et al., 2022a), Least-to-Most Prompting (Zhou et al., 2022a)\nScoring\nFunction (\u00a76)Channel prompt tuning (Min et al., 2022a), Structrured Prompting (Hao et al., 2022b),\nkNN-Prompting (Xu et al., 2023a)\nFigure 2: Taxonomy of in-context learning. The training and the inference stage are two main stages for ICL.\nDuring the training stage, existing ICL studies mainly take a pretrained LLM as backbone, and optionally warmup\nthe model to strengthen and generalize the ICL ability. Towards the inference stage, the demonstration designing\nand the scoring function selecting are crucial for the ultimate performance.\nquire further investigation in ICL. While the vanilla\nGPT-3 model itself shows promising ICL abilities,\nseveral studies observed that the ability could be\nsignificantly boosted via adaption during pretrain-\ning (Min et al., 2022b; Chen et al., 2022c). In\naddition, the performance of ICL is sensitive to spe-\ncific settings, including the prompting template, the\nselection of in-context examples, and order of ex-\namples, and so on (Zhao et al., 2021).

We\nhope that our work can encourage more re-\nsearch on uncovering how ICL works and\nimproving ICL.\n1 Introduction\nWith the scaling of model size and corpus size (De-\nvlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al.,\n2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), large language\nmodels (LLMs) demonstrate an in-context learn-\ning (ICL) ability, that is, learning from a few ex-\namples in the context. Many studies have shown\nthat LLMs can perform a series of complex tasks\nthrough ICL, such as solving mathematical reason-\ning problems (Wei et al., 2022c). These strong abil-\nities have been widely verified as emerging abilities\nfor large language models (Wei et al., 2022b).\nThe key idea of in-context learning is to learn\nfrom analogy. Figure 1 gives an example describ-\ning how language models make decisions with ICL.\nFirst, ICL requires a few examples to form a demon-\nstration context. These examples are usually writ-\nten in natural language templates. Then, ICL con-\ncatenates a query question and a piece of demon-\nstration context together to form a prompt, which\nReview: Delicious food! Review: The food is awful. … Review: Terrible dishes!\nPositiveLarge Language ModelReview: Good meal!Sentiment:\nInputSentiment: PositiveSentiment: Negative…Sentiment: NegativeOutputParameter Freeze kDemonstrationExamplesNewQuery \nTemplateDelicious food!  The food is awful. Terrible dishes!…Review: [Text] Sentiment: [Label]TextLabel100…\nFigure 1: Illustration of in-context learning. ICL re-\nquires a piece of demonstration context containing a few\nexamples written in natural language templates. Taking\nthe demonstration and a query as the input, large lan-\nguage models are responsible for making predictions.\nis then fed into the language model for prediction.\nDifferent from supervised learning requiring a train-\ning stage that uses backward gradients to update\nmodel parameters, ICL does not conduct parameter\nupdates and directly performs predictions on the\npretrained language models. The model is expected\nto learn the pattern hidden in the demonstration and\naccordingly make the right prediction.\nAs a new paradigm, ICL has multiple attractive\nadvantages. First, since the demonstration is writ-\nten in natural language, it provides an interpretable\ninterface to communicate with LLMs (Brown et al.,\n2020). This paradigm makes it much easier to in-\ncorporate human knowledge into LLMs by chang-\ning the demonstration and templates (Liu et al.,\n2022; Lu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2022c). Second, in-context learning is similar to\nthe decision process of human beings by learning\nfrom analogy (Winston, 1980). Third, compared\nwith supervised training, ICL is a training-free\nlearning framework. This could not only greatly re-\nduce the computation costs for adapting the model\n\ncontext2: In-context LearningTraining Warmup (§4)Supervised\nIn-context\nTraining (§4.1)MetaICL (Min et al., 2022b), OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022), FLAN (Wei et al., 2022a),\nSuper-NaturalInstructions (Wang et al., 2022c), Scaling Instruction (Chung et al., 2022),\nSymbol Tuning (Wei et al., 2023a)\nSelf-supervised\nIn-context\nTraining (§4.2)Self-supervised ICL (Chen et al., 2022a), PICL (Gu et al., 2023)\nInferenceDemonstration\nDesigning (§5)Organization (§5.1)Selecting\n(§5.1.1)KATE (Liu et al., 2022), EPR (Rubin et al., 2022), PPL (Gonen et al., 2022),\nSG-ICL (Kim et al., 2022a), Self Adaptive (Wu et al., 2022),MI (Sorensen et al., 2022),\nQ-Learning (Zhang et al., 2022a), Informative Score (Li and Qiu, 2023a),\nTopic (Wang et al., 2023e), UDR (Li et al., 2023f)\nOrdering\n(§5.1.2)GlobalE&LocalE (Lu et al., 2022)\nFormatting (§5.2)Instruction\n(§5.2.1)Instruction Induction (Honovich et al., 2022), APE (Zhou et al., 2022c),\nSelf-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022b)\nReasoning\nSteps\n(§5.2.2)CoT (Wang et al., 2022b), Complex CoT (Fu et al., 2022),\nAutoCoT (Zhang et al., 2022b), Self-Ask (Press et al., 2022),\nMoT(Li and Qiu, 2023b), SuperICL(Xu et al., 2023b)\niCAP (Wang et al., 2022a), Least-to-Most Prompting (Zhou et al., 2022a)\nScoring\nFunction (§6)Channel prompt tuning (Min et al., 2022a), Structrured Prompting (Hao et al., 2022b),\nkNN-Prompting (Xu et al., 2023a)\nFigure 2: Taxonomy of in-context learning. The training and the inference stage are two main stages for ICL.\nDuring the training stage, existing ICL studies mainly take a pretrained LLM as backbone, and optionally warmup\nthe model to strengthen and generalize the ICL ability. Towards the inference stage, the demonstration designing\nand the scoring function selecting are crucial for the ultimate performance.\nquire further investigation in ICL. While the vanilla\nGPT-3 model itself shows promising ICL abilities,\nseveral studies observed that the ability could be\nsignificantly boosted via adaption during pretrain-\ning (Min et al., 2022b; Chen et al., 2022c). In\naddition, the performance of ICL is sensitive to spe-\ncific settings, including the prompting template, the\nselection of in-context examples, and order of ex-\namples, and so on (Zhao et al., 2021). Furthermore,\nwhile intuitively reasonable, the working mecha-\nnism of the ICL remains unclear, and few studies\nhave provided preliminary explanations (Dai et al.,\n2022; von Oswald et al., 2022).\nWith the rapid growth of studies in ICL, our\nsurvey aims to sensitize the community toward the\ncurrent progress.

We\nhope that our work can encourage more re-\nsearch on uncovering how ICL works and\nimproving ICL.\n1 Introduction\nWith the scaling of model size and corpus size (De-\nvlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al.,\n2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), large language\nmodels (LLMs) demonstrate an in-context learn-\ning (ICL) ability, that is, learning from a few ex-\namples in the context. Many studies have shown\nthat LLMs can perform a series of complex tasks\nthrough ICL, such as solving mathematical reason-\ning problems (Wei et al., 2022c). These strong abil-\nities have been widely verified as emerging abilities\nfor large language models (Wei et al., 2022b).\nThe key idea of in-context learning is to learn\nfrom analogy. Figure 1 gives an example describ-\ning how language models make decisions with ICL.\nFirst, ICL requires a few examples to form a demon-\nstration context. These examples are usually writ-\nten in natural language templates. Then, ICL con-\ncatenates a query question and a piece of demon-\nstration context together to form a prompt, which\nReview: Delicious food!

ICL re-\nquires a piece of demonstration context containing a few\nexamples written in natural language templates. Taking\nthe demonstration and a query as the input, large lan-\nguage models are responsible for making predictions.\nis then fed into the language model for prediction.\nDifferent from supervised learning requiring a train-\ning stage that uses backward gradients to update\nmodel parameters, ICL does not conduct parameter\nupdates and directly performs predictions on the\npretrained language models. The model is expected\nto learn the pattern hidden in the demonstration and\naccordingly make the right prediction.\nAs a new paradigm, ICL has multiple attractive\nadvantages. First, since the demonstration is writ-\nten in natural language, it provides an interpretable\ninterface to communicate with LLMs (Brown et al.,\n2020). This paradigm makes it much easier to in-\ncorporate human knowledge into LLMs by chang-\ning the demonstration and templates (Liu et al.,\n2022; Lu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2022c). Second, in-context learning is similar to\nthe decision process of human beings by learning\nfrom analogy (Winston, 1980). Third, compared\nwith supervised training, ICL is a training-free\nlearning framework. This could not only greatly re-\nduce the computation costs for adapting the model\n\noutput: \n""]}",1749.0,"{""model"": ""gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"", ""model_name"": ""gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"", ""stream"": false, ""n"": 1, ""temperature"": 1e-08, ""_type"": ""openai-chat"", ""stop"": null}","{""generations"": [[{""text"": ""```{\""clarity\"": 3, \""depth\"": 3, \""structure\"": 3, \""relevance\"": 3}```"", ""generation_info"": {""finish_reason"": ""stop"", ""logprobs"": null}, ""type"": ""ChatGeneration"", ""message"": {""lc"": 1, ""type"": ""constructor"", ""id"": [""langchain"", ""schema"", ""messages"", ""AIMessage""], ""kwargs"": {""content"": ""```{\""clarity\"": 3, \""depth\"": 3, \""structure\"": 3, \""relevance\"": 3}```"", ""additional_kwargs"": {}, ""name"": null, ""id"": ""run-413b6529-e27e-40f4-bd8d-6afea270e5ad-0""}}}]], ""llm_output"": {""token_usage"": {""completion_tokens"": 28, ""prompt_tokens"": 1749, ""total_tokens"": 1777}, ""model_name"": ""gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"", ""system_fingerprint"": ""fp_c2295e73ad""}, ""run"": null}",application/json,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,28.0,"[{'message.role': 'assistant', 'message.content': '```{""clarity"": 3, ""depth"": 3, ""structure"": 3, ""relevance"": 3}```'}]","['Human: \n    Given a context, perform the following task and output the answer in VALID JSON format: Assess the provided context and assign a numerical score of 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), or 3 (High) for each of the following criteria in your JSON response:\n\nclarity: Evaluate the precision and understandability of the information presented.

The model is expected\nto learn the pattern hidden in the demonstration and\naccordingly make the right prediction.\nAs a new paradigm, ICL has multiple attractive\nadvantages. First, since the demonstration is writ-\nten in natural language, it provides an interpretable\ninterface to communicate with LLMs (Brown et al.,\n2020). This paradigm makes it much easier to in-\ncorporate human knowledge into LLMs by chang-\ning the demonstration and templates (Liu et al.,\n2022; Lu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Wei et al.,\n2022c). Second, in-context learning is similar to\nthe decision process of human beings by learning\nfrom analogy (Winston, 1980). Third, compared\nwith supervised training, ICL is a training-free\nlearning framework. This could not only greatly re-\nduce the computation costs for adapting the model\n\noutput: \n']"

Norm-reducing sets are always norm-like, an d norm-like sets are in turn\nalways Markov bases, but the reverse of both statements is fa lse in general (Example 3.4and\nExample 3.5). For collections PAhowever, every Markov basis is norm-like (Proposition 3.7).\nExample 3.4. For anyn\u2208N, consider the normal set Fn:= ([2]\u00d7[n]\u00d7{0})\u222a{(2,n,1)}with\nthe Markov basis {(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(\u22121,0,\u22121)}.

High scores (3) are reserved for contexts that are both precise in their information and easy to understand. Low scores (1) are for contexts where the information is vague or hard to comprehend.\ndepth: Determine the level of detailed examination and the inclusion of innovative insights within the context. A high score indicates a comprehensive and insightful analysis, while a low score suggests a superficial treatment of the topic.\nstructure: Assess how well the content is organized and whether it flows logically. High scores are awarded to contexts that demonstrate coherent organization and logical progression, whereas low scores indicate a lack of structure or clarity in progression.\nrelevance: Judge the pertinence of the content to the main topic, awarding high scores to contexts tightly focused on the subject without unnecessary digressions, and low scores to those that are cluttered with irrelevant information.\nStructure your JSON output to reflect these criteria as keys with their corresponding scores as values\n    \n\nThe output should be a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {""properties"": {""foo"": {""title"": ""Foo"", ""description"": ""a list of strings"", ""type"": ""array"", ""items"": {""type"": ""string""}}}, ""required"": [""foo""]}\nthe object {""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

High scores are awarded to contexts that demonstrate coherent organization and logical progression, whereas low scores indicate a lack of structure or clarity in progression.\nrelevance: Judge the pertinence of the content to the main topic, awarding high scores to contexts tightly focused on the subject without unnecessary digressions, and low scores to those that are cluttered with irrelevant information.\nStructure your JSON output to reflect these criteria as keys with their corresponding scores as values\n    \n\nThe output should be a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {""properties"": {""foo"": {""title"": ""Foo"", ""description"": ""a list of strings"", ""type"": ""array"", ""items"": {""type"": ""string""}}}, ""required"": [""foo""]}\nthe object {""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

LetPbe a collection of \ufb01nite subsets of Zd.

Norm-reducing sets are always norm-like, an d norm-like sets are in turn\nalways Markov bases, but the reverse of both statements is fa lse in general (Example 3.4and\nExample 3.5). For collections PAhowever, every Markov basis is norm-like (Proposition 3.7).\nExample 3.4. For anyn\u2208N, consider the normal set Fn:= ([2]\u00d7[n]\u00d7{0})\u222a{(2,n,1)}with\nthe Markov basis {(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(\u22121,0,\u22121)}. The distance between (1 ,1,0) and (2 ,1,0)\ninFn(M) is 2nand thus Mis not norm-like for {Fn:n\u2208N}(see also Figure 2).\nExample 3.5. Letd\u2208Nand consider A:= (1,...,1)\u2208Z1\u00d7d, then the set M:={e1\u2212ei:\n2\u2264i\u2264d}is a Markov basis for the collection PA. However, Mis not\u2225\u00b7\u2225p-norm-reducing for\nanyd\u22653 and any p\u2208[1,\u221e]. For instance, consider e2ande3inFA,1(M). The only move\nfromMthatcanbeappliedon e2ise1\u2212e2, but\u2225(e2+e1\u2212e2)\u2212e3)\u2225p=\u2225e2\u2212e3\u2225p. Ontheother\nhand, in the case we cannot \ufb01nd a move that decreases the 1-nor m of two nodes u,v\u2208 FA,b\nby 1, we can \ufb01nd instead two moves m1,m2\u2208 Msuch that u+m1,u+m1+m2\u2208 FA,band\n\u2225u+m1+m2\u2212v\u2225=\u2225u\u2212v\u2225\u22122. Thus, the graph-distance of any two elements uandvin\nFA,b(M) is at most \u2225u\u2212v\u22251and hence Mis norm-like for PA.\nFigure 2. The graph from Example 3.4\nRemark 3.6. LetPbe a collection of \ufb01nite subsets of ZdandM \u2282Zdbe norm-like for P.\nIt follows from the de\ufb01nition that there exists a constant C\u2208Q\u22650such that for all F \u2208 P\ndiam(F(M))\u2264C\u00b7max{\u2225u\u2212v\u2225:u,v\u2208 F}.\nTheproofofournextresultsusesthe Graver basis GA\u2282Zdforaninteger matrix A\u2208Zm\u00d7d\nwith ker Z(A)\u2229Nd={0}.

LetPbe a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd. A ﬁnite set M ⊂Zdis\nnorm-like forPif there exists a constant C∈Nsuch that for all F ∈ Pand allu,v∈ F,\ndistF(M)(u,v)≤C·∥u−v∥. The set Mis∥·∥-norm-reducing forPif for all F ∈ Pand all\nu,v∈ Fthere exists m∈ Msuch that u+m∈ Fand∥u+m−v∥<∥u−v∥.\nThe property of being norm-like does not depend on the norm, w hereas being norm-\nreducing does. Norm-reducing sets are always norm-like, an d norm-like sets are in turn\nalways Markov bases, but the reverse of both statements is fa lse in general (Example 3.4and\nExample 3.5). For collections PAhowever, every Markov basis is norm-like (Proposition 3.7).\nExample 3.4. For anyn∈N, consider the normal set Fn:= ([2]×[n]×{0})∪{(2,n,1)}with\nthe Markov basis {(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(−1,0,−1)}. The distance between (1 ,1,0) and (2 ,1,0)\ninFn(M) is 2nand thus Mis not norm-like for {Fn:n∈N}(see also Figure 2).\nExample 3.5. Letd∈Nand consider A:= (1,...,1)∈Z1×d, then the set M:={e1−ei:\n2≤i≤d}is a Markov basis for the collection PA. However, Mis not∥·∥p-norm-reducing for\nanyd≥3 and any p∈[1,∞]. For instance, consider e2ande3inFA,1(M). The only move\nfromMthatcanbeappliedon e2ise1−e2, but∥(e2+e1−e2)−e3)∥p=∥e2−e3∥p. Ontheother\nhand, in the case we cannot ﬁnd a move that decreases the 1-nor m of two nodes u,v∈ FA,b\nby 1, we can ﬁnd instead two moves m1,m2∈ Msuch that u+m1,u+m1+m2∈ FA,band\n∥u+m1+m2−v∥=∥u−v∥−2. Thus, the graph-distance of any two elements uandvin\nFA,b(M) is at most ∥u−v∥1and hence Mis norm-like for PA.\nFigure 2. The graph from Example 3.4\nRemark 3.6.

In particular, the augmentation length\nis independent of the right-hand side b. Letu,v∈ FA,bbe arbitrary and for i∈N, let\nli:= min{ui,vi},wi:= max{ui,vi}, andci:= sign(ui−vi)∈ {−1,0,1}. Thenvis the unique\noptimal value of the linear integer optimization problem\nmin{cTx:Ax=b,l≤x≤w,x∈Zd}.\nAdiscrete steepest decent as deﬁned in [5, Deﬁnition 3] using Graver moves needs at most\n∥c∥1·d·(rank(A)+1)≤d2·(rank(A)+1) many augmentations from uto reach the optimal\nvaluev. We refer to [5, Corollary 8] which ensures that every Graver move is used at most\nonce. Note that in [5], xis constrained to x≥0 instead to x≥l, but their argument works\nfor any lower bound.\nExample 5.3. Fixd∈Nand consider AandMfrom Example 3.5. We show that Mis an\naugmenting Markov basis for FA,bfor anyb∈N. Letu,v∈ FA,bbe distinct, then there exists\ni∈[d] such that ui> viorui< vi, thus, we can walk from utou′:=u+(ui−vi)(e1−ei)\nor from vtov′:=v+ (vi−ui)(e1−ei). In any case, after that augmentation, the pairs\n(u′,v) and (v′,u) coincide in the ith coordinate and thus we ﬁnd an augmenting path by\ninduction on the dimension d. We have used at most d−1 many edges in these paths and\nhenceAM(FA,b)≤d−1 for all b∈N.\nWe now show that the augmentation length is essentially boun ded from below by the\ndimension of the node set and hence the bound observed in Exam ple5.3cannot be improved.\nWe ﬁrst need the following lemma.\nLemma 5.4. Letv1,...,vk∈Qdsuch that any v∈spanQ{v1,...,vk}can be represented by\na linear combination of rvectors. Then dim(spanQ{v1,...,vk})≤r.\nProof.LetB⊂P(v1,...,vk) the set of all subsets of cardinality r. By our assumption,\n∪B∈BspanQ{B}= spanQ{v1,...,vk}. Since dim(spanQ{B})≤rfor allB∈Band since B\nis ﬁnite, the claim follows. □\nProposition 5.5. LetP ⊂Qdbe polytope and let M ⊂Zdbe an augmenting Markov basis\nforFi:= (i·P)∩Zdfor alli∈N. Thendim(P)≤maxi∈NAM(Fi).\noutput: \n']"

Then for any positive mass\nfunction f:M →[0,1], there exists ǫ >0such that λ(Hπi,f\nFi,M)≤1−ǫfor alli∈N.\nProof.This is a straightforward application of Theorem 5.8. □\nCorollary 5.11. LetP ⊂Zdbe a polytope, Fi:= (i· P)∩Zdfori∈N, and let πibe the\nuniform distribution on Fi. Suppose that M ⊂Zdis an augmenting Markov basis {Fi:i∈N}\nsuch that AM(Fi)≤dim(P)for alli∈N. Then for any positive mass function f:M →[0,1],\nthere exists ǫ >0such that λ(Hπi,f\nFi,M)≤1−ǫfor alli∈N.\nProof.Letr:= dim(P). Weﬁrstshowthat( |RFi,M|)i∈N∈ O(i)i∈N. WriteM={m1,...,m k}\nand denote by li:= max{|(u+mi·Z)∩P|:u∈ P}be the length of the longest ray through\nthe polytope Palongmi. It suﬃces to prove that i·(lk+ 1) is an upper bound on the\nlength of any ray along mkthrough Fi. For that, let u∈ Fisuch that u+λmk∈ Fifor\nsomeλ∈N, then1\niu+λ\nimk∈ Pand thus ⌊λ\ni⌋ ≤lk, which gives λ≤i·(lk+ 1). With\nC:= max{l1,...,lk}+ 1 we have |RFi,M| ≤C·i. Ehrhart’s theorem [2, Theorem 3.23]\ngives (|Fi|)i∈N∈Ω(ir)i∈Nand since |RFi,M| ≤C·i, we have ( |RFi,M|r)i∈N∈ O(|Fi|)i∈N. An\napplication of Corollary 5.10proves the claim. □\nExample 5.12.

Many studies have shown\nthat LLMs can perform a series of complex tasks\nthrough ICL, such as solving mathematical reason-\ning problems (Wei et al., 2022c). These strong abil-\nities have been widely verified as emerging abilities\nfor large language models (Wei et al., 2022b).\nThe key idea of in-context learning is to learn\nfrom analogy. Figure 1 gives an example describ-\ning how language models make decisions with ICL.\nFirst, ICL requires a few examples to form a demon-\nstration context. These examples are usually writ-\nten in natural language templates. Then, ICL con-\ncatenates a query question and a piece of demon-\nstration context together to form a prompt, which\nReview: Delicious food!

Taking\nthe demonstration and a query as the input, large lan-\nguage models are responsible for making predictions.\nis then fed into the language model for prediction.\nDifferent from supervised learning requiring a train-\ning stage that uses backward gradients to update\nmodel parameters, ICL does not conduct parameter\nupdates and directly performs predictions on the\npretrained language models. The model is expected\nto learn the pattern hidden in the demonstration and\naccordingly make the right prediction.\nAs a new paradigm, ICL has multiple attractive\nadvantages. First, since the demonstration is writ-\nten in natural language, it provides an interpretable\ninterface to communicate with LLMs (Brown et al.,\n2020).

Second, in-context learning is similar to\nthe decision process of human beings by learning\nfrom analogy (Winston, 1980).

This ap-\nproach fine-tunes language models on in-context\ninput-label pairs, substituting natural language la-\nbels (e.g., ""positive/negative sentiment"") with arbi-\ntrary symbols (e.g., ""foo/bar""). As a result, symbol\ntuning demonstrates an enhanced capacity to utilize\nin-context information for overriding prior seman-\ntic knowledge.\nBesides, recent work indicates the potential\nvalue of instructions (Mishra et al., 2021) and there\nis a research direction focusing on supervised in-\nstruction tuning. Instruction tuning enhances the\nICL ability of LLMs through training on task in-\nstructions. Tuning the\noutput: \n']"

Con-\nsequently, PICL outperforms Chen et al. (2022a)\u2019s\nmethod in effectiveness and task generalizability.\n3Takeaway :(1) Supervised training and self-\nsupervised training both propose to train the LLMs\nbefore ICL inference. The key idea is to bridge the\ngap between pretraining and downstream ICL for-\nmats by introducing objectives close to in-context\nlearning. Compared to in-context finetuning involv-\ning demonstration, instruction finetuning without a\nfew examples as demonstration is simpler and more\npopular.

LetF ⊂Zdbe a ﬁnite set and M ⊂Zd. The graph F(M) is the graph on\nFwhere two nodes u,v∈ Fare adjacent if u−v∈ Morv−u∈ M.\nA normal set F ⊂Zdis ﬁnite and satisﬁes F= conv Q(F)∩Zd. A canonical class of normal\nsets that arise in many applications, is given by the ﬁbers of an integer matrix:\nDeﬁnition 2.2. LetA∈Zm×dandb∈NA. The set FA,b:={u∈Nd:Au=b}is theb-ﬁber\nofA. The collection of all ﬁbers of AisPA:={FA,b:b∈NA}. ForM ⊂kerZ(A), the graph\nFA,b(M) is aﬁber graph .\nLetF,M ⊂Zdbe ﬁnite. If the membership in Fcan be veriﬁed eﬃciently – for instance\nwhenFis given implicitly by linear equations and inequalities – t hen it is possible to explore\nFrandomly using Mas follows: At a given node v∈ F, a uniform element m∈ Mis\nselected. If v+m∈ M, then the random walk moves along mtov+mand ifv+m̸∈ M,\nthe we stay at v. Formally, we obtain the following random walk.\nDeﬁnition 2.3. LetF ⊂ZdandM ⊂Zdbe two ﬁnite sets. The simple walk is the random\nwalk onF(M) wheretheprobability totraversebetween toadjacent node suandvis|±M|−1\nand the probability to stay at a node uis|{m∈ ±M:u+m̸∈ F}|·|±M|−1.\nThe simple walk is symmetric and hence the uniform distribut ion is a stationary distribu-\ntion (see also [27\noutput: \n']"

LetA∈Zm×dandP:={\n{x∈Zd:Ax=b,l≤x≤u}:l,u∈Zd,b∈Zm}\n.\nThen for all F ∈ P,diam(Fc(GA))≤2d−2.\nProof.Lets,t∈ {x∈Zd:Ax=b,l≤x≤u}, thens−t∈kerZ(A) and thus s=t+∑r\ni=1λigi\nwithr≤2d−2,λ1,...,λ r∈N>0, and distinct g1,...,gr∈ GAsuch that gi⊑s−taccording\nto Lemma 3.12.

For all\nu,v∈ F,distFc\ni(M)(iu,iv)≤distF(M)(u,v)for alli∈N.\nProof.The statement is trivially true if uandvare disconnected in F(M). Thus, assume\nthe contrary and let u=v+∑k\nj=1mjwithmj∈ Mbe a path in F(M) of length k=\ndistF(M)(u,v) and let i∈N. Clearly, i·u=i·v+i·∑k\nj=1mj=i·v+∑k\nl=1i·mj, so\nit is left to prove that the elements traversed by this paths a re inFi. Letl∈[k], since\nv+∑l\nj=1mj∈ F, we have i·v+∑l\nj=1i·mj∈i·F ⊆ F i. Hence, this is a path in Fc\ni(M)\nof length k= distF(M)(u,v). □\nWe are ready to prove that the diameter of compressed ﬁbergra phs coming from an integer\nmatrix can be bounded for all right-hand sides simultaneous ly.\nTheorem 3.15. LetA∈Zm×dwithkerZ(A)∩Nd={0}and letMbe a Markov basis for\nPA. There exists a constant C∈Nsuch that diam(Fc(M))≤Cfor allF ∈ PA.\nProof.Our proof relies on basic properties of the Graver basis GAofA. For any g∈ GA,\nletFg:=FA,Ag+and letK:= max{distFg(M)(g+,g−) :g∈ GA}. We show that the\ndiameter of any compressed ﬁber graph of Ais bounded from above by (2 d−2)·K.

If the input of Algorithm 1is a normal set F={u\u2208Zd:Au\u2264b}that is given\ninH-representation, then the length of the ray RF,m(v) can be computed with a number of\nrounding, division, and comparing operations that is linea r in the number of rows of A.\nThere are situations in which the heat-bath random walk prov ides no speed-up compared\nwith the simple walk (Example 4.3). Intuitively, adding more moves to the set of allowed\nmoves should improve the mixing time of the random walk. In ge neral, however, this is not\ntrue for the heat-bath walk (Example 4.4).\nExample 4.3. Forn\u2208N, consider the normal set\nFn:={[\n0 1 1 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b71\n1 0 0 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70]\n,[\n1 0 1 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b71\n0 1 0 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b70]\n,...,[\n1 1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b71 0\n0 0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b70 1]}\n\u2282Q2\u00d7n.\nIn the language of [7, Section 1.1], Fnis precisely the \ufb01ber of the 2 \u00d7nindependence model\nwhere row sums are ( n\u22121,1) and column sums are (1 ,1,...,1). The minimal Markov\nbasis of the independence model, often referred to as the basic moves , is precisely the set\nMn:={v\u2212u:u,v\u2208 Fn} \\ {0}. In particular, the \ufb01ber graph Fn(Mn) is the complete\ngraph on nnodes. All rays along basic moves have length 2 and thus the tr ansition matrices\nof the simple random walk and the heat-bath random walk coinc ide. There are n\u00b7(n\u22121)\nmany basic moves and the transition matrix of both random wal ks is\n1\nn(n\u22121)\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f01...1\n......\n1...1\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb+(n(n\u22121)\u2212n)\nn(n\u22121)\u00b7In.\nThe second largest eigenvalue is 1 \u22121\nn\u22121which implies that for n\u2192 \u221e, neither the simple\nwalk nor the heat-bath random walk are rapidly mixing.\nExample 4.4. LetF= [2]\u00d7[5]\u2282Z2,M={e1,e2,2e1+e2}, and let \u03c0be the uniform\ndistribution on F. Since {e2,2e1+e2}is not a Markov basis for F, any mass function\nf:M \u2192[0,1] must have f(e1)>0 in order to make the corresponding heat-bath random\nwalk irreducible. Comparing the second largest eigenvalue modulus of heat-bath random\nwalks that sample from {e1,e2}andMuniformly, we obtain\n\u03bb(1\n2H\u03c0\nF,e1+1\n2H\u03c0\nF,e2)\n=1\n2<2\n3=\u03bb(1\n3H\u03c0\nF,e1+1\n3H\u03c0\nF,e2+1\n3H\u03c0\nF,2e1+e2)\n.\nSo, adding 2 e1+e2to the set of allowed moves slows the walk down. This phenomen on does\nnot appear for the simple walk on F, where the second largest eigenvalue modulus improves\nfrom\u22480.905 to\u22480.888 when adding the move 2 e1+e2to the Markov basis.\n= + +\nFigure 3.

If the input of Algorithm 1is a normal set F={u∈Zd:Au≤b}that is given\ninH-representation, then the length of the ray RF,m(v) can be computed with a number of\nrounding, division, and comparing operations that is linea r in the number of rows of A.\nThere are situations in which the heat-bath random walk prov ides no speed-up compared\nwith the simple walk (Example 4.3). Intuitively, adding more moves to the set of allowed\nmoves should improve the mixing time of the random walk. In ge neral, however, this is not\ntrue for the heat-bath walk (Example 4.4).\nExample 4.3. Forn∈N, consider the normal set\nFn:={[\n0 1 1 ···1\n1 0 0 ···0]\n,[\n1 0 1 ···1\n0 1 0 ···0]\n,...,[\n1 1···1 0\n0 0···0 1]}\n⊂Q2×n.\nIn the language of [7, Section 1.1], Fnis precisely the ﬁber of the 2 ×nindependence model\nwhere row sums are ( n−1,1) and column sums are (1 ,1,...,1). The minimal Markov\nbasis of the independence model, often referred to as the basic moves , is precisely the set\nMn:={v−u:u,v∈ Fn} \\ {0}. In particular, the ﬁber graph Fn(Mn) is the complete\ngraph on nnodes. All rays along basic moves have length 2 and thus the tr ansition matrices\nof the simple random walk and the heat-bath random walk coinc ide. There are n·(n−1)\nmany basic moves and the transition matrix of both random wal ks is\n1\nn(n−1)\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f01...1\n......\n1...1\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb+(n(n−1)−n)\nn(n−1)·In.\nThe second largest eigenvalue is 1 −1\nn−1which implies that for n→ ∞, neither the simple\nwalk nor the heat-bath random walk are rapidly mixing.\nExample 4.4. LetF= [2]×[5]⊂Z2,M={e1,e2,2e1+e2}, and let πbe the uniform\ndistribution on F. Since {e2,2e1+e2}is not a Markov basis for F, any mass function\nf:M →[0,1] must have f(e1)>0 in order to make the corresponding heat-bath random\nwalk irreducible. Comparing the second largest eigenvalue modulus of heat-bath random\nwalks that sample from {e1,e2}andMuniformly, we obtain\nλ(1\n2Hπ\nF,e1+1\n2Hπ\nF,e2)\n=1\n2<2\n3=λ(1\n3Hπ\nF,e1+1\n3Hπ\nF,e2+1\n3Hπ\nF,2e1+e2)\n.\nSo, adding 2 e1+e2to the set of allowed moves slows the walk down. This phenomen on does\nnot appear for the simple walk on F, where the second largest eigenvalue modulus improves\nfrom≈0.905 to≈0.888 when adding the move 2 e1+e2to the Markov basis.\n= + +\nFigure 3.

Re-\ncent explorations first generate instruction tuning\ndatasets transforming existing vision-language task\ndataset (Xu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a) or with\npower LLMs such as GPT-4 (Liu et al., 2023; Zhu\net al., 2023a) , and connect LLMs with powerful vi-\nsion foundational models such as BLIP-2 (Li et al.,\n2023c) on these multi-modal datasets (Zhu et al.,\n2023a; Dai et al., 2023).\n9.3 Speech In-Context Learning\nIn the speech area, Wang et al. (2023a) treated text-\nto-speech synthesis as a language modeling task.\nThey use audio codec codes as an intermediate rep-\nresentation and propose the first TTS framework\nwith strong in-context learning capability. Subse-\nquently, V ALLE-X (Zhang et al., 2023b) extend the\nidea to multi-lingual scenarios, demonstrating su-\nperior performance in zero-shot cross-lingual text-\nto-speech synthesis and zero-shot speech-to-speech\ntranslation tasks.\n3Takeaway :(1) Recent studies have explored\nin-context learning beyond natural language with\npromising results. Properly formatted data (e.g.,\ninterleaved image-text datasets for vision-language\ntasks) and architecture designs are key factors\nfor activating the potential of in-context learning.\nExploring it in a more complex structured space\nsuch as for graph data is challenging and promis-\ning (Huang et al., 2023a). (2) Findings in textual\nin-context learning demonstration design and selec-\ntion cannot be trivially transferred to other modal-\nities. Domain-specific investigation is required to\nfully leverage the potential of in-context learning\nin various modalities.\n10 Application\nICL manifests excellent performance on traditional\nNLP tasks and methods (Kim et al., 2022a; Min\net al., 2022b), such as machine translation (Zhu\net al., 2023b; Sia and Duh, 2023), information ex-\ntraction (Wan et al., 2023; He et al., 2023) and\ntext-to-SQL (Pourreza and Rafiei, 2023). Espe-\ncially, through demonstrations that explicitly guide\nthe process of reasoning, ICL manifests remark-\nable effects on tasks that require complexity reason-\ning (Wei et al., 2022c; Li et al., 2023b; Zhou et al.,\n2022b) and compositional generalization (Zhou\net al., 2022a).\nMoreover, ICL offers potential for popular meth-ods such as meta-learning and instruction-tuning.\nChen et al. (2022d) applied ICL to meta-learning,\nadapting to new tasks with frozen model parame-\nters, thus addressing the complex nested optimiza-\ntion issue. (Ye et al., 2023b) enhanced zero-shot\ntask generalization performance for both pretrained\nand instruction-finetuned models by applying in-\ncontext learning to instruction learning.\nSpecifically, we explore several emerging and\nprevalent applications of ICL, showcasing their\npotential in the following paragraphs.\nData Engineering ICL has manifested the po-\ntential to be widely applied in data engineering.\nBenefiting from the strong ICL ability, it costs 50%\nto 96% less to use labels from GPT-3 than using la-\nbels from humans for data annotation. Combining\npseudo labels from GPT-3 with human labels leads\nto even better performance at a small cost (Wang\net al., 2021). In more complex scenarios, such as\nknowledge graph construction, Khorashadizadeh\net al. (2023) has demonstrated that ICL has the po-\ntential to significantly improve the state of the art of\nautomatic construction and completion of knowl-\nedge graphs, resulting in a reduction in manual\ncosts with minimal engineering effort.

Re-\ncent explorations first generate instruction tuning\ndatasets transforming existing vision-language task\ndataset (Xu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a) or with\npower LLMs such as GPT-4 (Liu et al., 2023; Zhu\net al., 2023a) , and connect LLMs with powerful vi-\nsion foundational models such as BLIP-2 (Li et al.,\n2023c) on these multi-modal datasets (Zhu et al.,\n2023a; Dai et al., 2023).\n9.3 Speech In-Context Learning\nIn the speech area, Wang et al. (2023a) treated text-\nto-speech synthesis as a language modeling task.\nThey use audio codec codes as an intermediate rep-\nresentation and propose the first TTS framework\nwith strong in-context learning capability. Subse-\nquently, V ALLE-X (Zhang et al., 2023b) extend the\nidea to multi-lingual scenarios, demonstrating su-\nperior performance in zero-shot cross-lingual text-\nto-speech synthesis and zero-shot speech-to-speech\ntranslation tasks.\n3Takeaway :(1) Recent studies have explored\nin-context learning beyond natural language with\npromising results. Properly formatted data (e.g.,\ninterleaved image-text datasets for vision-language\ntasks) and architecture designs are key factors\nfor activating the potential of in-context learning.\nExploring it in a more complex structured space\nsuch as for graph data is challenging and promis-\ning (Huang et al., 2023a). (2) Findings in textual\nin-context learning demonstration design and selec-\ntion cannot be trivially transferred to other modal-\nities. Domain-specific investigation is required to\nfully leverage the potential of in-context learning\nin various modalities.\n10 Application\nICL manifests excellent performance on traditional\nNLP tasks and methods (Kim et al., 2022a; Min\net al., 2022b), such as machine translation (Zhu\net al., 2023b; Sia and Duh, 2023), information ex-\ntraction (Wan et al., 2023; He et al., 2023) and\ntext-to-SQL (Pourreza and Rafiei, 2023). Espe-\ncially, through demonstrations that explicitly guide\nthe process of reasoning, ICL manifests remark-\nable effects on tasks that require complexity reason-\ning (Wei et al., 2022c; Li et al., 2023b; Zhou et al.,\n2022b) and compositional generalization (Zhou\net al., 2022a).\nMoreover, ICL offers potential for popular meth-ods such as meta-learning and instruction-tuning.\nChen et al. (2022d) applied ICL to meta-learning,\nadapting to new tasks with frozen model parame-\nters, thus addressing the complex nested optimiza-\ntion issue. (Ye et al., 2023b) enhanced zero-shot\ntask generalization performance for both pretrained\nand instruction-finetuned models by applying in-\ncontext learning to instruction learning.\nSpecifically, we explore several emerging and\nprevalent applications of ICL, showcasing their\npotential in the following paragraphs.\nData Engineering ICL has manifested the po-\ntential to be widely applied in data engineering.\nBenefiting from the strong ICL ability, it costs 50%\nto 96% less to use labels from GPT-3 than using la-\nbels from humans for data annotation. Combining\npseudo labels from GPT-3 with human labels leads\nto even better performance at a small cost (Wang\net al., 2021). In more complex scenarios, such as\nknowledge graph construction, Khorashadizadeh\net al. (2023) has demonstrated that ICL has the po-\ntential to significantly improve the state of the art of\nautomatic construction and completion of knowl-\nedge graphs, resulting in a reduction in manual\ncosts with minimal engineering effort. Therefore,\nleveraging the capabilities of ICL in various data\nengineering applications can yield significant bene-\nfits. Compared to human annotation (e.g., crowd-\nsourcing) or noisy automatic annotation (e.g., dis-\ntant supervision), ICL generates relatively high\nquality data at a low cost. However, how to use ICL\nfor data annotation remains an open question. For\nexample, Ding et al. (2022) performed a compre\noutput: \n']"

(2022b), language\nmodel objectives are not equal to ICL abilities. Re-\nsearchers have proposed to bridge the gap between\npretraining objectives and ICL through interme-\ndiate tuning before inference (Section 4), which\nshows promising performance improvements. To\ntake it further, tailored pretraining objectives and\nmetrics for ICL have the potential to raise LLMs\nwith superior ICl capabilities.\n11.2 ICL Ability Distillation\nPrevious studies have shown that in-context learn-\ning for reasoning tasks emerges as the scale of\ncomputation and parameter exceed a certain thresh-\nold (Wei et al., 2022b). Transferring the ICL ability\nto smaller models could facilitate the model deploy-\nment greatly. Magister et al. (2022) showed that it\nis possible to distill the reasoning ability to small\nlanguage models such as T5-XXL. The distillationis achieved by finetuning the small model on the\nchain-of-thought data (Wei et al., 2022c) generated\nby a large teacher model. Although promising per-\nformance is achieved, the improvements are likely\ntask-dependent. Further investigation on improv-\ning the reasoning ability by learning from larger\nLLMs could be an interesting direction.\n11.3 ICL Robustness\nPrevious studies have shown that ICL performance\nis extremely unstable, from random guess to SOTA,\nand can be sensitive to many factors, including\ndemonstration permutation, demonstration format,\netc. (Zhao et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2022). The robust-\nness of ICL is a critical yet challenging problem.\nHowever, most of the existing methods fall into\nthe dilemma of accuracy and robustness (Chen\net al., 2022c), or even at the cost of sacrificing\ninference efficiency. To effectively improve the\nrobustness of ICL, we need deeper analysis of the\nworking mechanism of the ICL. We believe that\nthe analysis of the robustness of the ICL from a\nmore theoretical perspective rather than an empir-\nical perspective can highlight future research on\nmore robust ICL.\n11.4 ICL Efficiency and Scalability\nICL necessitates prepending a significant number\nof demonstrations within the context. However, it\npresents two challenges: (1) the quantity of demon-\nstrations is constrained by the maximum input\nlength of LMs, which is significantly fewer com-\npared to fine-tuning (scalability); (2) as the number\nof demonstrations increases, the computation cost\nbecomes higher due to the quadratic complexity of\nattention mechanism (efficiency). Previous work in\n\u00a75 focused on exploring how to achieve better ICL\nperformance using a limited number of demonstra-\ntions and proposed several demonstration design-\ning strategies. Scaling ICL to more demonstrations\nand improving its efficiency remains a challenging\ntask.\nRecently, some works have been proposed to ad-\ndress the issues of scalability and efficiency of ICL.\nEfforts were made to optimize prompting strate-\ngies with structured prompting (Hao et al., 2022b),\ndemonstration ensembling (Khalifa et al., 2023),\ndynamic prompting\noutput: \n""]}",1196.0,"{""model"": ""gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"", ""model_name"": ""gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"", ""stream"": false, ""n"": 1, ""temperature"": 1e-08, ""_type"": ""openai-chat"", ""stop"": null}","{""generations"": [[{""text"": ""{\""keyphrases\"": [\""In-context learning\"", \""Knowledge editing\"", \""ICL abilities\"", \""Pretraining strategies\"", \""ICL robustness\""]}"", ""generation_info"": {""finish_reason"": ""stop"", ""logprobs"": null}, ""type"": ""ChatGeneration"", ""message"": {""lc"": 1, ""type"": ""constructor"", ""id"": [""langchain"", ""schema"", ""messages"", ""AIMessage""], ""kwargs"": {""content"": ""{\""keyphrases\"": [\""In-context learning\"", \""Knowledge editing\"", \""ICL abilities\"", \""Pretraining strategies\"", \""ICL robustness\""]}"", ""additional_kwargs"": {}, ""name"": null, ""id"": ""run-b6b79a4a-ff46-4c0c-a9de-210b2d4d548a-0""}}}]], ""llm_output"": {""token_usage"": {""completion_tokens"": 30, ""prompt_tokens"": 1196, ""total_tokens"": 1226}, ""model_name"": ""gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"", ""system_fingerprint"": ""fp_c2295e73ad""}, ""run"": null}",application/json,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,30.0,"[{'message.role': 'assistant', 'message.content': '{""keyphrases"": [""In-context learning"", ""Knowledge editing"", ""ICL abilities"", ""Pretraining strategies"", ""ICL robustness""]}'}]","['Human: Extract the top 3 to 5 keyphrases from the provided text, focusing on the most significant and distinctive aspects. \n\nExamples:\n\ntext: ""A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.
