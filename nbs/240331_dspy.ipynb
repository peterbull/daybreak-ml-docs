Secondly, we know that Marco scored 10% less than this average. So, let's calculate how many points less he scored. If the average is 90, then Marco's score would be 90 minus 10%, which is 81.

She gave Joe and Darcy half of the remaining slices, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the total number of slices. After giving Joe and Darcy their share, she had 3/4 of the original number of slices left. Then, Nancy gave Carl a quarter of the remaining slices.

Firstly, we know that Karen packed 20 pounds of water and 10 pounds of food. We also know that she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour and eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water per hour. So, let's calculate how much water and food she consumed during her hike. After six hours, Karen would have consumed 12 pounds of water (6 hours * 2 pounds) and 4 pounds of food (6 hours * 2/3 pound). Then, we subtract the weight of the consumed water and food from the total weight of water and food that she packed to find out how much weight is left.\n",

      "Question: The average score on last week's Spanish test was 90. Marco scored 10% less than the average test score and Margaret received 5 more points than Marco. What score did Margaret receive on her test?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find out how many points Margaret got. First, we know that the average score was 90. Secondly, we know that Marco scored 10% less than this average. So, let's calculate how many points less he scored. If the average is 90, then Marco's score would be 90 minus 10%, which is 81. Thirdly, we know that Margaret received 5 more points than Marco. Let's find out how many points she got by adding 5 to Marco's score of 81.\n",

      "Question: Nancy bought a pie sliced it into 8 pieces. She gave 1/2 to Joe and Darcy, and she gave 1/4 to Carl. How many slices were left?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find out how many slices were left. Firstly, we know that Nancy bought a pie and sliced it into 8 pieces. She gave Joe and Darcy half of the remaining slices, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the total number of slices. After giving Joe and Darcy their share, she had 3/4 of the original number of slices left. Then, Nancy gave Carl a quarter of the remaining slices. We can find out how many slices were left by finding out how many slices Carl got and then subtracting that from the total number of slices Nancy had after giving Joe and Darcy their share.\n",
