      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find out how many slices were left. Firstly, we know that Nancy bought a pie and sliced it into 8 pieces. She gave Joe and Darcy half of the remaining slices, which is equivalent to 1/2 * (8 - 2) = 4 slices. Then she gave Carl one fourth of the remaining slices, which is equivalent to 1/4 * (8 - 6) = 2 slices. So how many slices were left?\n",

We know that Martha's cat catches 3 rats and 7 birds, so the total number of animals caught by Martha's cat is 3 + 7 = 10. Cara's cat catches five times as many animals as Martha's cat, but she catches three less than that.
